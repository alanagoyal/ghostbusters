# Multiple People Detection - Implementation Summary

## Problem Fixed
The system was only saving ONE person per frame to the database, even when multiple people were detected. If three kids walked up in costumes, only the highest-confidence detection was saved, losing the other two.

## Solution Implemented
Modified `/root/repo/detect_people.py` to handle multiple people in the same frame by:

### Key Changes (Lines 118-185)

1. **Collect ALL detected people** (lines 131-148)
   - Instead of tracking just the highest confidence person
   - Now builds a list of ALL people with confidence > 0.5
   - Each person gets their own entry with bounding box and confidence

2. **Create separate database entries** (lines 159-182)
   - Loop through all detected people
   - Each person gets their own `save_detection()` call
   - Each person becomes a separate row in the database

3. **Individual person images** (lines 164-173)
   - When multiple people detected: crop and save individual images
   - Naming: `detection_20251029_031418_person1.jpg`, `_person2.jpg`, etc.
   - When single person: uses full frame (no cropping needed)

4. **Better logging** (lines 153-156)
   - Single person: "ðŸ‘¤ Person detected!"
   - Multiple people: "ðŸ‘¥ 3 people detected!"
   - Shows count per person when saving cropped images

## Benefits

### 1. No Data Loss
- **Before**: 3 kids = 1 database entry (66% data loss)
- **After**: 3 kids = 3 database entries (0% data loss)

### 2. Better Costume Classification
- Individual cropped images focus on each person
- Easier for AI to classify individual costumes
- No confusion from multiple costumes in one image

### 3. Accurate Counting
- Detection counter now shows total people seen
- Each person tracked individually with their own confidence score

### 4. Efficient Storage
- Full frame saved once: `detection_20251029_031418.jpg`
- Individual crops: `_person1.jpg`, `_person2.jpg`, etc.
- Single person case optimized (no extra cropping)

## Test Results

Run `python3 test_multiple_people.py` to verify:

```
Test 1: Single person â†’ 1 database entry âœ…
Test 2: Three people â†’ 3 database entries âœ…
Test 3: Five people â†’ 5 database entries âœ…
```

Previously would have created only 3 entries total (one per frame).
Now correctly creates 9 entries (one per person detected).

## Database Schema

No changes needed! The existing `person_detections` table already supports this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person_detections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
  confidence FLOAT,
  bounding_box JSONB,  -- Stores each person's coordinates
  image_url TEXT,      -- Points to individual person image
  device_id TEXT,
  costume_classification TEXT,
  costume_confidence FLOAT
);
```

Each person gets:
- Their own UUID (id)
- Same timestamp (when frame was captured)
- Individual confidence score
- Individual bounding box coordinates
- Individual cropped image URL (for multi-person frames)

## Example Scenario

**Before Fix:**
```
3 kids walk up at 7:32 PM
- YOLOv8 detects all 3
- Only kid #2 (highest confidence) saved to database
- Kid #1 and #3 lost forever
- Database: 1 entry
```

**After Fix:**
```
3 kids walk up at 7:32 PM
- YOLOv8 detects all 3
- Full frame saved: detection_20251029_193200.jpg
- Kid 1 cropped: detection_20251029_193200_person1.jpg
- Kid 2 cropped: detection_20251029_193200_person2.jpg
- Kid 3 cropped: detection_20251029_193200_person3.jpg
- Database: 3 entries (one per kid)
- Each entry ready for individual costume classification
```

## Files Modified

- `/root/repo/detect_people.py` (lines 118-185)
  - Core detection and database insertion logic
  - No changes to YOLO model, RTSP connection, or other functionality

## Files Created

- `/root/repo/test_multiple_people.py`
  - Unit test to verify logic without RTSP connection
  - Simulates 1, 3, and 5 person scenarios

## Next Steps

When costume classification is implemented (Baseten integration):
1. Each person's cropped image will be sent to Baseten
2. Each gets individual costume classification
3. Database updated with `costume_classification` and `costume_confidence` per person

## Performance Notes

- Minimal overhead: only crops images when multiple people detected
- Single person case optimized (no extra processing)
- Database insertions happen sequentially but fast (< 100ms each)
- No change to YOLO processing or RTSP stream handling
