# Blog Notes: Building a Doorstep Costume Classifier

*A living document tracking the implementation journey, decisions, and learnings*

---

## Project Overview

Building an edge computer vision system that watches a DoorBird doorbell camera on Halloween night, detects trick-or-treaters, classifies their costumes using AI, and displays live results on a public dashboard.

**Tech Stack:**
- Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM) - edge compute
- DoorBird doorbell - camera/RTSP stream
- YOLOv8n - person detection
- Baseten API - costume classification (vision-language model)
- Supabase - database + realtime
- Next.js on Vercel - live dashboard

## Day 1: Specification & Architecture Design

### Initial Concept

Started with the idea of watching the doorbell camera and counting costumes. Original plan was to use a **fixed label set** with CLIP zero-shot classification (witch, skeleton, spider-man, etc.).

### Key Decision: Open-Ended Classification

**The Problem with Fixed Labels:**
- Halloween costumes are incredibly creative and diverse
- Fixed labels would miss unique costumes (inflatable T-Rex, "Barbenheimer", DIY creations)
- Would need constant maintenance/updates to the label list
- Less interesting data - just counts vs. rich descriptions

**The Pivot:**
Switched to **open-ended classification** using vision-language models that generate natural language descriptions.

Examples:
- Instead of: "witch"
- We get: "witch with purple hat and broom"

This captures much more detail and handles unexpected costumes gracefully.

### Architecture Decision: Baseten for ML Inference

**Why not run everything on the Pi?**
- Pi 5 has 8GB RAM, could theoretically run small vision-language models
- But: Halloween night is time-sensitive, we want reliability
- Running heavy ML models on Pi = heat issues, potential slowdowns

**Why Baseten?**
- Offload the heavy ML to cloud infrastructure
- Pi only needs to run lightweight YOLO for person detection
- Auto-scaling handles traffic spikes (what if 20 kids show up at once?)
- Model flexibility - can swap models without touching Pi code
- Low latency optimized inference
- Cost-effective: estimated $0.50-$10 for the whole night

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires internet connection (already needed for Supabase anyway)
- Sends cropped images to cloud (but we're only sending costume crops, not faces)
- Small API cost vs. free local inference

Decision: **Go with Baseten** for reliability and simplicity.

### Data Flow Architecture

```
DoorBird (RTSP)
  → Pi 5 (YOLO person detection)
  → Baseten API (costume description)
  → Supabase (store + realtime)
  → Next.js dashboard (live updates)
```

Clean separation of concerns:
- Edge device (Pi): frame capture, person detection, orchestration
- Cloud ML (Baseten): heavy inference
- Database (Supabase): storage + pubsub
- Frontend (Vercel): presentation

### Privacy Considerations

**Privacy-first design:**
- All processing happens on cropped person images, not full frames
- Face blurring before saving any local thumbnails
- Only text descriptions uploaded to Supabase (no images)
- No identifiable faces in the cloud or on the public dashboard

**Transparency:**
- Planning to put a sign near the candy bowl: "Costume Counter: We're counting costumes tonight using local AI. No faces are stored or posted."

### Hardware Decisions

**Why Raspberry Pi 5?**
- 8GB RAM sufficient for YOLO inference
- Quad-core CPU handles video streaming + HTTP requests
- Built-in Wi-Fi/Ethernet
- Headless operation (SSH only)

**Cooling is critical:**
- CanaKit fan + heatsink
- Will be running inference continuously for 3-4 hours
- Don't want thermal throttling ruining Halloween night

**Why not use a webcam?**
- Already have DoorBird installed at the door
- RTSP stream works perfectly over LAN
- One less thing to install/configure

## Technical Decisions Log

| Decision | Options Considered | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| Classification approach | Fixed labels vs. Open-ended | Open-ended | Captures creative costumes, more interesting data |
| ML inference location | Local (Pi) vs. Cloud (Baseten) | Baseten | Reliability, auto-scaling, model flexibility |
| Person detection | YOLO vs. Faster R-CNN vs. MobileNet | YOLOv8n | Good balance of speed/accuracy, runs well on Pi |
| Database | Supabase vs. Firebase vs. self-hosted Postgres | Supabase | Realtime built-in, good DX, easy RLS |
| Frontend host | Vercel vs. Netlify vs. self-hosted | Vercel | Best Next.js integration, edge functions |

## Questions to Answer in Blog Post

- [ ] How accurate is the costume classification?
- [ ] What's the latency from detection to dashboard update?
- [ ] How much did it cost to run for one Halloween night?
- [ ] What were the most common costumes?
- [ ] What were the most creative/unexpected costumes the AI detected?
- [ ] Any funny misclassifications?
- [ ] How did the Pi perform under load?
- [ ] Would we do anything differently?

## Ideas for Future Iterations

- Add support for group costumes (detect multiple people, classify as a group)
- Sentiment analysis (are they smiling? excited?)
- Age estimation (kids vs. teens vs. adults)
- Candy distribution analytics (correlate costume quality with candy given)
- Historical data (compare year-over-year costume trends)
- Multi-camera support (front door + back door)
