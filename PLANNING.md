# Halloween Costume Detection Project - Planning Document

## Project Overview

This project creates an interactive Halloween experience by detecting costumes of trick-or-treaters using computer vision and displaying them in real-time on a website.

## Problem Statement

Create an engaging, real-time display of Halloween costumes detected at your doorstep using your DoorBird doorbell camera feed, making the Halloween experience more interactive and memorable.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
- Capture video stream from DoorBird doorbell camera
- Detect and classify Halloween costumes using computer vision
- Display detected costumes in real-time on an interactive web interface
- Create a fun, engaging visual experience for Halloween night

### Secondary Goals
- Track statistics (most popular costume, total visitors, etc.)
- Allow visitors to see themselves on the display
- Create a memorable experience that can be shared

## Scope

### In Scope
- Integration with DoorBird camera API
- Real-time video stream processing
- Computer vision-based costume detection and classification
- Web-based real-time display interface
- Basic costume categories (witch, ghost, superhero, princess, etc.)
- Deployment for single Halloween event

### Out of Scope
- Face recognition or personal identification
- Long-term data storage beyond the event
- Mobile application
- Multi-camera support
- Advanced authentication/security features
- Integration with smart home automation

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Video Stream Capture**
   - Connect to DoorBird camera RTSP/HTTP stream
   - Process video at reasonable frame rate (1-5 fps for analysis)
   - Handle network interruptions gracefully

2. **Costume Detection**
   - Detect presence of people at the door
   - Classify costumes into predefined categories
   - Handle multiple people in frame
   - Provide confidence scores for detections

3. **Real-time Display**
   - Update display within 2-3 seconds of detection
   - Show costume type with visual representation
   - Display smooth animations/transitions
   - Support multiple concurrent viewers

4. **Data Management**
   - Store detections temporarily (session-based)
   - Track basic statistics
   - Export event log at end of night

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Process and display detections within 3 seconds
- **Reliability**: System uptime > 95% during Halloween night
- **Scalability**: Support 10-50 concurrent web viewers
- **Usability**: Display should be viewable from across the room
- **Privacy**: No permanent storage of video footage or identifiable information

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Backend
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, YOLOv8, or MediaPipe
- **ML Framework**: PyTorch or TensorFlow
- **API Framework**: FastAPI or Flask
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets (Socket.IO or native WebSockets)

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React or Vue.js
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS or styled-components
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO client or native WebSockets
- **Animations**: Framer Motion or CSS animations

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Local network deployment (Raspberry Pi, local server, or laptop)
- **Database**: SQLite or Redis (for temporary session data)
- **Containerization**: Docker (optional, for easier deployment)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| DoorBird API limitations | High | Medium | Test API thoroughly early; have fallback RTSP stream option |
| Poor costume detection accuracy | High | Medium | Use pre-trained models; collect training data early; have manual override |
| Network latency/interruptions | Medium | Low | Implement retry logic; buffer detections; use local processing |
| Insufficient compute resources | Medium | Medium | Optimize model size; reduce frame rate; use GPU if available |
| Too many simultaneous visitors | Low | Low | Process every N seconds; queue detections |
| Privacy concerns | Medium | Low | Clear signage; no persistent storage; local processing only |

## Success Metrics

- **Detection Accuracy**: >70% correct costume classification
- **Response Time**: <3 seconds from detection to display
- **System Uptime**: >95% during event hours
- **User Engagement**: Positive feedback from visitors
- **Technical Performance**: Smooth display updates without lag

## Budget Estimate

- **Hardware**: $0 (using existing DoorBird camera)
- **Software/APIs**: $0-50 (potential API costs for CV services if not self-hosted)
- **Compute**: $0-20 (cloud compute if needed, or use local hardware)
- **Total**: $0-70

## Resource Requirements

### Hardware
- DoorBird doorbell camera
- Local server/computer (min 8GB RAM, preferably with GPU)
- Display device for showing the interface
- Stable network connection

### Personnel
- 1 Developer (full-stack with ML experience)
- Time commitment: 40-60 hours over 6 weeks

## Constraints

- Must be operational by October 31st
- Limited to existing DoorBird hardware
- Must respect privacy (no facial recognition, no permanent video storage)
- Budget-conscious (prefer open-source solutions)
- Single-night event (Halloween)

## Future Enhancements (Post-Halloween)

- Multi-year tracking and comparison
- Social media integration
- Voting system for best costume
- Sound/music integration
- Augmented reality effects
- Integration with other smart home devices
- Support for other camera brands
