# Doorstep Costume Classifier

Raspberry Pi edge computer vision system that watches a DoorBird doorbell camera on Halloween night, detects trick-or-treaters, classifies their costumes using AI, and displays live results on a public dashboard.

## üéÉ Tech Stack

- **Edge Compute:** Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM)
- **Camera:** DoorBird doorbell (RTSP stream)
- **Person Detection:** YOLOv8n
- **Costume Classification:** Baseten API (vision-language model)
- **Database & Storage:** Supabase (with Realtime via WebSocket)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Hosting:** Vercel (dashboard)
- **Package Manager:** uv (by Astral) for Python, npm for JavaScript

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- DoorBird camera on local network

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alanagoyal/costume-classifier.git
   cd costume-classifier
   ```

2. **Install uv (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual credentials
   ```

### Testing

**Test Baseten API connection:**
```bash
uv run test_baseten_connection.py
```

**Test with single-person costume images:**
```bash
uv run test_costume_detection.py
```
This processes the test images in `test_images/`, classifies costumes with Baseten, and uploads to Supabase.

**Test multi-person detection:**
```bash
uv run test_multiple_people.py
```
This uses YOLOv8n to detect ALL people in each frame (including test-6.png and test-7.png with 3 kids each), processes each person separately, and creates individual database entries. Perfect for testing group scenarios like multiple trick-or-treaters arriving together.

**Test DoorBird camera connection:**
```bash
uv run test_doorbird_connection.py
```

**Test Supabase integration:**
```bash
uv run test_supabase_connection.py
```

**Run live person detection:**
```bash
uv run detect_people.py
```
Watches the RTSP stream, detects all people in each frame, classifies their costumes, and uploads to Supabase. Handles multiple people in the same frame automatically.

**Test face blurring (privacy feature):**
```bash
uv run test_face_blur.py
```
Verifies that the face blurring module is working correctly. All images saved locally and uploaded to Supabase automatically have faces blurred for privacy.

**Test face blurring on an image:**
```bash
uv run face_blur.py test_images/test-1.png output_blurred.jpg
```

## üîí Privacy Features

All detection scripts now include automatic face blurring:
- **Local storage:** Faces are blurred before saving to filesystem
- **Cloud uploads:** Only face-blurred images are sent to Supabase Storage
- **API calls:** Face-blurred crops are sent to Baseten for costume classification
- **Algorithm:** OpenCV Haar Cascade face detection + Gaussian blur
- **Transparency:** System logs how many faces were blurred per detection

No identifiable faces are stored or transmitted, ensuring visitor privacy while still capturing costume data.

## ü•ß Raspberry Pi Management

### Connecting to Your Pi

**SSH into the Pi:**
```bash
ssh pi@halloween-pi.local
```

**When you're done working:**
```bash
# Simply exit the SSH session
exit
# OR press Ctrl+D
```

### Power Management

**When to shut down:**
- Not using the Pi for several hours/days
- Moving the Pi to a different location
- Before unplugging power

**How to safely shut down:**
```bash
# Shut down (safe to unplug after LED stops blinking)
sudo shutdown -h now

# OR
sudo poweroff
```

**How to reboot:**
```bash
sudo reboot
```

**Leaving the Pi running:**
- ‚úÖ Safe to leave running 24/7 (designed for it)
- ‚úÖ Uses ~3-5W of power when idle
- ‚úÖ SSH sessions can be closed without affecting the Pi
- ‚úÖ Good practice if you'll use it again within a few hours

**Best practice:**
- Exit SSH when done (keeps connection clean)
- Leave Pi powered on if using it regularly
- Only shut down if not using for extended periods or moving hardware

### Monitoring Pi Health

**Check temperature:**
```bash
vcgencmd measure_temp
# Normal: 40-60¬∞C idle, up to 70¬∞C under load
# Warning: 80¬∞C+ (check cooling)
```

**Check disk space:**
```bash
df -h
```

**Update system packages:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## üìä Dashboard

The project includes a real-time Next.js dashboard for monitoring detections live.

### Dashboard Setup

1. **Navigate to dashboard directory:**
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Add your Supabase credentials
   ```

4. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open dashboard:**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### How Realtime Works

The dashboard uses Supabase Realtime to show new detections instantly:

1. **Enable Realtime** for the `person_detections` table (run in Supabase SQL Editor):
   ```sql
   alter publication supabase_realtime add table person_detections;
   ```

2. The dashboard subscribes to changes via WebSocket
3. New detections appear immediately without page refresh
4. Sub-second latency from detection to display

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

This project uses modern Python tooling from [Astral](https://astral.sh/):
- **uv** - Fast, reliable package management
- **ruff** - Lightning-fast linting and formatting

### Package Management

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Add a new dependency
uv add package-name

# Add a dev dependency
uv add --dev package-name

# Run a script
uv run python script.py
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Check code with linter
uv run ruff check .

# Auto-fix linting issues
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Run both linting and formatting
uv run ruff check . --fix && uv run ruff format .
```
